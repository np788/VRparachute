# VRparachute
This is a virtual reality parachuting program created for Ken Perlin's Advanced Computer Graphics class at NYU. This was my first (and so far, only) project created in Unity. All assets were downloaded from the Unity Asset Store. What's unique about this project is that is utilized a GameTrak controller, which allows joystick input along three axes, rather than just two. This allowed the user to mimic the movement of pulling on the parachute strings to control their movement and speed. They would wear an HTC Vive headset for the full VR experience. Although I have not done any further work in Unity, this was a lot of fun.
